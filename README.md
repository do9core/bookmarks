# Bookmarks Bucket

A small set of applications not in scoop official buckets.

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add <bucketname> https://github.com/do9core/bookmarks
scoop install <bucketname>/<manifestname>
```

## Manifest source from other buckets
